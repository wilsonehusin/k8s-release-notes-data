commit: c5759ab86d9813269bd61108dec43ef36a993e02
text: The new `-gce-zones` flag on the `e2e.test` binary instructs tests that check
  for information about how the cluster interacts with the cloud to limit their queries
  to the provided zone list. If not specified, the current behavior of asking the
  cloud provider for all available zones in multi zone clusters is preserved.
