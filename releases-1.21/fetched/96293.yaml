  feat: azure file migration go beta in 1.21. Feature gates CSIMigration to Beta (on by default) and CSIMigrationAzureFile to Beta (off by default since it requires installation of the AzureFile CSI Driver)
  The in-tree AzureFile plugin "kubernetes.io/azure-file" is now deprecated and will be removed in 1.23. Users should enable CSIMigration + CSIMigrationAzureFile features and install the AzureFile CSI Driver (https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/azurefile-csi-driver) to avoid disruption to existing Pod and PVC objects at that time.
  Users should start using the AzureFile CSI Driver directly for any new volumes.
