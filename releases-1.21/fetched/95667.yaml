commit: 7aca4978500d2da5053197f9ddac782fa9c233f4
text: |-
  The BoundServiceAccountTokenVolume feature has been promoted to beta, and enabled by default.
  - This changes the tokens provided to containers at `/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token` to be time-limited, auto-refreshed, and invalidated when the containing pod is deleted.
  - Clients should reload the token from disk periodically (once per minute is recommended) to ensure they continue to use a valid token. `k8s.io/client-go` version v11.0.0+ and v0.15.0+ reload tokens automatically.
  - By default, injected tokens are given an extended lifetime so they remain valid even after a new refreshed token is provided. The metric `serviceaccount_stale_tokens_total` can be used to monitor for workloads that are depending on the extended lifetime and are continuing to use tokens even after a refreshed token is provided to the container. If that metric indicates no existing workloads are depending on extended lifetimes, injected token lifetime can be shortened to 1 hour by starting `kube-apiserver` with `--service-account-extend-token-expiration=false`.
