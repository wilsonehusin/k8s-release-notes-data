text: |-
  The apimachinery util/net function used to detect the bind address `ResolveBindAddress()`
  takes into consideration global ip addresses on loopback interfaces when:
      - the host has default routes
      - there are no global IPs on those interfaces.
  in order to support more complex network scenarios like BGP Unnumbered RFC 5549
