commit: 5e22f7feadeb97aa8fad9330c936104479ad56d6
text: kube-proxy's IPVS proxy mode no longer sets the net.ipv4.conf.all.route_localnet
  sysctl parameter. Nodes upgrading will have net.ipv4.conf.all.route_localnet set
  to 1 but new nodes will inherit the system default (usually 0). If you relied on
  any behavior requiring net.ipv4.conf.all.route_localnet, you must set ensure it
  is enabled as kube-proxy will no longer set it automatically. This change helps
  to further mitigate CVE-2020-8558.
