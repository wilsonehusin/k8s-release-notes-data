commit: 377ed3c2a638d38d46c1471a901903a7ced21561
text: DaemonSets accept a MaxSurge integer or percent on their rolling update strategy
  that will launch the updated pod on nodes and wait for those pods to go ready before
  marking the old out-of-date pods as deleted. This allows workloads to avoid downtime
  during upgrades when deployed using DaemonSets. This feature is alpha and is behind
  the DaemonSetUpdateSurge feature gate.
