text: '`kubectl exec` and `kubectl attach` now honor the `--quiet` flag which suppresses
  output from the local binary that could be confused by a script with the remote
  command output (all non-failure output is hidden). In addition, print inline with
  exec and attach the list of alternate containers when we default to the first spec.container.'
