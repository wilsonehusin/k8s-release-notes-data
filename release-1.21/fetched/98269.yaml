text: 'kubeadm: apply the "node.kubernetes.io/exclude-from-external-load-balancers"
  label on control plane nodes during "init", "join" and "upgrade" to preserve backwards
  compatibility with the lagacy LB mode where nodes labeled as "master" where excluded.
  To opt-out you can remove the label from a node. See #97543 and the linked KEP for
  more details.'
