commit: 6aab94eff924bd3fcc6af241327a5381d079b279
text: the metric `storage_operation_errors_total` is not removed, but is marked deprecated,
  and the metric `storage_operation_status_count` is marked deprecated. In both cases
  the storage_operation_duration_seconds metric can be used to recover equivalent
  counts (using `status=fail-unknown` in the case of `storage_operations_errors_total`).
