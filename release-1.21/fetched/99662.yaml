commit: 36244f31ef78dd3dd6bfbb74e1b15b4d01edcd6c
text: EndpointSlice API is now GA. The EndpointSlice topology field has been removed
  from the GA API and will be replaced by a new per Endpoint Zone field. If the topology
  field was previously used, it will be converted into an annotation in the v1 Resource.
  The discovery.k8s.io/v1alpha1 API is removed.
