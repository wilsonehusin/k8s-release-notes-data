  ## Changelog

  ### General
  - Fix priority expander falling back to a random choice even though there is a higher priority option to choose
  - Clone `kubernetes/kubernetes` in `update-vendor.sh` shallowly, instead of fetching all revisions
  - Speed up binpacking by reducing the number of PreFilter calls (call once per pod instead of #pods*#nodes times)
  - Speed up finding unneeded nodes by 5x+ in very large clusters by reducing the number of PreFilter calls
  - Expose `--max-nodes-total` as a metric
  - Errors in `IncreaseSize` changed fromt type `apiError` to `cloudProviderError`
  - Make `build-in-docker` and `test-in-docker` work on Linux systems with SELinux enabled
  - Fix an error where existing nodes were not considered as destinations while finding place for pods in scale-down simulations
  - Remove redundant log lines and reduce severity around parsing kubeEnv
  - Don't treat nodes created by virtual kuebelet as nodes from non-autoscaled node groups
  - Remove redundant logging around calculating node utilization
  - Add configurable `--network` and `--rm` flags for docker in `Makefile`
  - Substract DaemonSet pods' requests from node allocatable in the denominator while computing node utilization
  - Include taints by condition when determining if a node is unready/still starting
  - Fix `update-vendor.sh` to work on OSX and zsh
  - Add best-effort eviction for DaemonSet pods while scaling down non-empty nodes
  - Add build support for ARM64

  ### AliCloud
  - Add missing daemonsets and replicasets to ALI example cluster role

  ### Apache CloudStack
  - Add support for Apache CloudStack

  ### AWS
  - Regenerate list of EC2 instances
  - Fix pricing endpoint in AWS China Region

  ### Azure
  - Add optional jitter on initial VMSS VM cache refresh, keep the refreshes spread over time
  - Serve from cache for the whole period of ongoing throttling
  - Fix unwanted VMSS VMs cache invalidations
  - Enforce setting the number of retries if cloud provider backoff is enabled
  - Don't update capacity if VMSS provisioning state is updating
  - Support allocatable resources overrides via VMSS tags
  - Add missing stable labels in template nodes
  - Proactively set instance status to deleting on node deletions

  ### Cluster API
  - Migrate interaction with the API from using internal types to using Unstructured
  - Improve tests to work better with constrained resources
  - Add support for node autodiscovery
  - Add support for `--cloud-config`
  - Update group identifier to use for Cluster API annotations

  ### Exoscale
  - Add support for Exoscale

  ### GCE
  - Decrease the number of GCE Read Requests made while deleting nodes
  - Base pricing of custom instances on their instance family type
  - Add pricing information for missing machine types
  - Add pricing information for different GPU types
  - Ignore the new `topology.gke.io/zone` label when comparing groups
  - Add missing stable labels to template nodes

  ### HuaweiCloud
  - Add auto scaling group support
  - Implement node group by AS
  - Implement getting desired instance number of node group
  - Implement increasing node group size
  - Implement TemplateNodeInfo
  - Implement caching instances

  ### IONOS
  - Add support for IONOS

  ### Kubemark
  - Skip non-kubemark nodes while computing node infos for node groups.

  ### Magnum
  - Add Magnum support in the Cluster Autoscaler helm chart

  ### Packet
  - Allow empty nodepools
  - Add support for multiple nodepools
  - Add pricing support
