  kubelet: the HostPort implementation in dockershim was not taking into consideration the HostIP field, causing that the same HostPort can not be used with different IP addresses.
  This bug causes the conformance test "HostPort validates that there is no conflict between pods with same hostPort but different hostIP and protocol" to fail.
