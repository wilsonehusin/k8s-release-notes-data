commit: 4013bd17c328d0f419a9915e8e25178febb2be62
text: On single-stack configured (IPv4 or IPv6, but not both) clusters, Services which
  are both headless (no clusterIP) and selectorless (empty or undefined selector)
  will report `ipFamilyPolicy RequireDualStack` and will have entries in `ipFamilies[]`
  for both IPv4 and IPv6.  This is a change from alpha, but does not have any impact
  on the manually-specified Endpoints and EndpointSlices for the Service.
