text: |-
  When a CNI plugin returns dual-stack pod IPs, kubelet will now try to respect the
  "primary IP family" of the cluster by picking a primary pod IP of the same family
  as the (primary) node IP, rather than assuming that the CNI plugin returned the IPs
  in the order the administrator wanted (since some CNI plugins don't allow
  configuring this).
