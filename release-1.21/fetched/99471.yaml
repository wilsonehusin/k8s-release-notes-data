commit: 504b86ced771d44dccbd305bab30d4ba2ee4615e
text: 'kubeadm: during "init" an empty cgroupDriver value in the KubeletConfiguration
  is now always set to "systemd" unless the user is explicit about it. This requires
  existing machine setups to configure the container runtime to use the "systemd"
  driver. Documentation on this topic can be found here: https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/container-runtimes/.
  When upgrading existing clusters / nodes using "kubeadm upgrade" the old cgroupDriver
  value is preserved, but in 1.22 this change will also apply to "upgrade". For more
  information on migrating to the "systemd" driver or remaining on the "cgroupfs"
  driver see: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/kubeadm/configure-cgroup-driver/.'
